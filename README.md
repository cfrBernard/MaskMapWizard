# MaskMapWizard

This is a simple Python app, designed to help you create Mask Maps by combining multiple textures (such as Metallic, AO, Detail, and Smoothness) into a single RGBA image. It‚Äôs a powerful solution for optimizing textures in Unity HDRP, where these maps are commonly used to improve material performance.

## Features:
- Drag and drop support for texture files ‚Äì (Metallic, AO, Detail, Smoothness).
- Automatically resizes and merges the maps into a single RGBA image.
- Supports Unity HDRP conventions ‚Äì (Metallic in Red, AO in Green, Detail in Blue, and Smoothness in Alpha).
- Supports inversion of Roughness maps to Smoothness ‚Äì (HDRP needs it).
- Missing channels are automatically filled with black (0) ‚Äì avoiding broken maps or crashes.
- Path selection for output files.

## How to Use:
- Drag and Drop the Metallic, AO, Detail, and Smoothness textures into their respective fields. (If you don‚Äôt have a texture for one of the channels, leave it empty)
- Select the Export Path where you want the final Mask Map to be saved.
- Hit Build to create your combined Mask Map.
- Check the Console for messages and updates.

## üîÆ What's Coming:

- **Support for other engines:** Introducing presets for different game engines like Unreal Engine (ORM), with configurable channel order.
- **Customizable Mask Map settings:** Ability to invert Smoothness to Roughness, select channel order, and tweak other settings for flexibility.
- **Advanced Mapping Options:** Define exactly which maps go into which RGBA channels.
- **Improved UI:** A more polished user interface with intuitive features and better error handling.

## Notes:
- This tool is currently Unity HDRP-focused, but it will evolve to support more engines.
- Feel free to contribute by adding engine-specific presets, new features, or bug fixes!
- For additional tips and troubleshooting, refer to the [tips & troubleshooting](docs/tips_troubleshooting.md) section.
